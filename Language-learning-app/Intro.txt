This is a language learning app where flash cards are shown. You need to think of the translated word which will be shown after 2 seconds. If you are correct, you press the green checkmark, if you were incorrect you press the red X. Every time you get a card correct it is taken out of the deck, forcing you to repeat the ones you didn't get correct until you get them correct.

There are 4 levels, beginner, medium, hard and expert. At the start of the app you need to select which difficulty level you take.


I scraped the 100 most common used words for each available language in order to be able to quickly pick up the langauge if you were ever to visit the country.

In arabic there are grammar symbols that can tell you how to pronounce a word, but they are not written down in commonly used arabic. As such, I thought it was nice to implement an actual voice to say the word out loud to help with understanding which word is being meant as there is no context.

In order for the voice to actually say the words out loud, the voice language has to be installed first. I did not know how to properly do this so I used Puneet Singh's solution: https://puneet166.medium.com/how-to-added-more-speakers-and-voices-in-pyttsx3-offline-text-to-speech-812c83d14c13

Then I used pyttsx3 to read the text out loud via text to speech.
